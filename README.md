run pod install in project directory and you will be able to run the project

I have used two library one is Lottie to show animation on waiting view and other SdWebImage to load and cache image 

Multiple extension were made to make the code more moduler and readable (View, ViewController, UICollectionViewCell, UIImageView)

Thanks you
